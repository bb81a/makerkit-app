Supabase needs a few settings to be configured in their Dashboard to work correctly. This guide will walk you through the steps to get your Supabase authentication setup.

## Authentication URLs

The first thing you need to do is to set the authentication URLs in the Supabase Dashboard. These URLs are used to redirect users to the correct page after they have logged in or signed up.

1. Go to the [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.io/).
2. Click on the project you want to use.
3. Go to the **Authentication** tab.
4. Click on **URL Configuration**.
5. Add your Site URL to the **Site URL** field. This is the URL of your MakerKit site (e.g. `https://my-site.com`).
6. Add your Redirect URLs to the **Redirect URLs** field. You need to add at least two URLs: This is the URL of your MakerKit site with `/auth/callback` appended to it (e.g. `https://my-site.com/auth/callback`) and another for redirecting users to their password reset page (e.g. `https://my-site.com/settings/profile/password`).

## Custom SMTP (optional)

If you want to send emails from your own domain, you can configure your SMTP settings in the Supabase Dashboard.

This is optional, but recommended if you want to send emails from your own domain.

1. Go to the [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.io/).
2. Click on the project you want to use.
3. Go to the **Project Settings** tab.
4. Click on **Auth**.
5. Tweak the `SMTP Settings` settings to your liking according to your provider's documentation.
