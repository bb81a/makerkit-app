description: How to run the application in development mode

After installing the modules, we can finally run the
application in development mode.

We need to execute two commands (and an optional one for Stripe):

1. **Next.js Server**: the first command is for running the Next.js server
2. **Supabase Environment**: the second command is for running the Supabase
environment with Docker
3. **Stripe CLI**: finally, the Stripe CLI is needed to dispatch webhooks to
our local server (optional, only needed when interacting with Stripe)

## About this Documentation

This documentation complements the Supabase one and is not meant to be a replacement. We recommend reading the Supabase documentation to get a better understanding of the Supabase concepts and how to use it.
