description: How to run the Stripe CLI for Webhooks in a local development environment
---

Run the Stripe CLI with the following command:

```bash
npm run stripe:listen
```

#### Add the Stripe Webhooks Key to your environment file

If this is the first time you run this command, you will need to copy the Webhooks key printed on the console and add it to your development environment variables file:

```bash title=".env.development"
STRIPE_WEBHOOKS_KEY=<PASTE_KEY_HERE>
```
